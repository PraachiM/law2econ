!-- Intro —

We will create the following folders/ directories to manage the files

1.  data

2.  data/raw (i.e. a folder titled 'raw' within the 'data' folder)

3.  data/processed (i.e. a folder titled 'raw' within the 'data' folder)

4.  fig

### Step 1: Obtain files from election Commission of India (ECI)

Go to the [ECI](https://www.eci.gov.in/disclosure-of-electoral-bonds) website and download these files into your "data/*raw*" folder:

1.  *"Details of Electoral Bonds submitted by SBI on 21st March 2024 (EB_Redemption_Details)"* ➡️ \[**rename this file '*party.pdf'***\]

    ![Data on redemption of bonds by political parties](image/party.png){width="1800"}

2.  *"Details of Electoral Bonds submitted by SBI on 21st March 2024 (EB_Purchase_Details)"* ➡️ \[**rename this file '*buyer.pdf'***\]

    ![Data on purchase of bonds by political parties](image/buyer.png){width="1800"}

### Step 2: Convert files from pdf to data frame

We will use Tabula to convert the pdf to a table and data frame for further processing

-   Install [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/)

-   Open the zip folder installed

-   Open the Tabula application. It will open in a browser window

-   Browse ➜ select file ➜ import

    ![Tabula screen](image/tabula.png){width="1800"}

-   Select the table on page and then select from the drop down: 'Repeat this Selection/ Repeat to all Pages' ➜ 'Preview and Export the Extracted data'

    ![](image/tabula_selection.png){width="1800"}

Export to 'data/raw' folder as csv. The files will be labelled **tabula_buyer.csv** & **tabula_party.csv**

### Step 3: Starting the cleaning process

1.  Converting csv to data frame

    The csv will be saved and minimally processed. They will be saved in the 'data/processed' folder

    ```{r}

    ```

2.  Checking for data completeness in the csv files

    -- The buyer.pdf has 18871 rows

    -- The party.pdf has 20421 rows

    ```{r}

    ```
