### About this blog

Hi, this is Praachi 👋. I am a new student of economics, with many years of experience as a lawyer.

Most of what I am studying now is both new and hard for me. The maths; analysis using R, STATA or python; econometrics; models of thinking about problems: all of it is a steep learning curve, but very satisfactory.

One of the primary reasons for choosing law after school was to get away from maths. However, as one learns over time, there is really no getting away from logic or maths. So here I am, very slowly working my way through them.

The blog is me documenting my research and analysis.
